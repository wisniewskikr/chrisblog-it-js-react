USAGE COMMANDS
--------------

> Please be aware that following tools should be installed on your local PC: **Minikube**.

> Please be aware that Kubernetes requres that **image is deployed on some Docker repository**. This example uses following image: `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/wisniewskikr/js-react-gui-html-helloworld-docker-single-image/general` 

> Please **clone/download** project, open **project's main folder** in your favorite **command line tool** and then **proceed with steps below**. 

Usage steps:
1. In a command line tool (in **administrator** mode) start Minikube tool with `minikube start`
1. In a command line tool create Kubernetes elements with `kubectl apply -f kubernetes.yaml`
1. In a command line tool check Pod status with `kubectl get pod`
   * Expected **READY 1/1** and **STATUS Running** (please check it few times - it can take few minutes) 
1. In a command line tool (in **administrator** mode) open service in browser with `minikube service helloworld-service`
   * Expected **Hello World** message in a browser
1. (Optional) Check Kubernetes elements
     * In a command line tool check Hello World Deployment with `kubectl describe deployment helloworld-deployment`
     * In a command line tool check Hello World Service with `kubectl describe service helloworld-service`
1. Clean up environment 
     * In a command line tool remove Kubernetes elements with `kubectl delete -f kubernetes.yaml`
     * In a command line tool (in **administrator** mode) stop Minikube tool with `minikube stop`

DESCRIPTION
-----------

##### Goal
The goal of this project is to present how to orchestrate Docker containers by **Kubernetes (Minikube)** tool - basing on example of an application type **GUI HTML** in **JavaScript** programming language with usage **react** framework.

##### Terminology
Terminology explanation:
* **JavaScript**: is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages or to implement web applications.
* **GUI HTML**: it's an abbreviation for Graphical User Interface. It enables user to interact with application. GUI HTML means that user interacts with application via html web pag.
* **React framework**: It’s used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.
* **Docker**: this tool enables separating applications from computer. It means that instead installing application directly on computer we install them on Docker. In this way we can easly add, remove and modify any application without changing our computer system.
* **Kubernetes (Minikube)**: this tool enables ochestrating Docker containers. It means that you can configure many Docker containers in one file and manage them by one Kubernetes command.

##### Flow
The following flow takes place in this project:
1. User via any html browser sends request to application for the content.
1. Application sends back response to user via html browser with message

##### Launch
To launch this application please make sure that the **Preconditions** are met and then follow instructions from **Usage** section.
